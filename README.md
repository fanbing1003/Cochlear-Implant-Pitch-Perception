# Cochlear-Implant-Pitch-Perception
Cochlear Implant Pitch Perception Data Extraction and Analysis  
This is used to extract reference tone frequency and reference tone frequency from event logfile.  
There are five tasks in the experiment, including 'pitch_matching_double_aided', 'pitch_matching_assess_aided', 'pitch_matching_assess_unaided', 'pitch_matching_asssess_unaided_as_control', 'pitch_matching_both_ears_desktop_speaker'.  
There are several log file that is used to test the application and try some different task. This file also find the different and save it into different foloder.  
The visualisation.ipynb visualise the matching result. Then save the result task by task for analysis.  
The TaskbyTask2.R is find the relationship between matching difference, number of trail and reference tone frequency which is scaled to be scientific notation.  
We found that the tasks that use cochlear implant to listen the reference need a constnat term to explain the relationship mentioned earlier.
